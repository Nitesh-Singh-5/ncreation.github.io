<b><mark>"Work is Worship"</mark></b> <br><b style="color:#41B3A3;">Nitesh Singh(204 Om Hostel)</b><br>Success is not a one-shot process. It is the result of a continuous improvement after each failure.<br> The fear of failure needs to be captured in order for a person to learn from his failure too.<br> It is an invaluable opportunity to rectify errors and move forward. Failure in working for a good cause is better than success in working for a wrong cause.<br>
